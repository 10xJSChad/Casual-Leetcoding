# My Vault of Leetcode Solutions!
I enjoy writing code, but unfortunately I don't always have active projects to work on, so this is what I do when I don't have any projects to work on!
My Leetcode solutions are in no way meant to be super optimal and clean, I really only do these because I just like writing code and solving 'puzzles'.

The solutions are mostly going to be in C++ and C# because those are my preferred languages.
