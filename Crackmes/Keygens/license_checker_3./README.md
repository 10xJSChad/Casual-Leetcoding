I honestly forgot everything about this one except for the password requirements, which are:

* It should only consist of numeric characters (0-9).
* The length of the password should be less than 8 characters.
* The sum of all the digits in the password must be exactly 50.

This is more or less everything I can say about it, can't remember anything about how I found the solution, it was definitely not obfuscated in any way, though.
